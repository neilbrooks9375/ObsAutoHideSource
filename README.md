# ObsAutoHideSource
Hide an OBS source after a set amount of time.

This is essentially a fork of https://github.com/cg2121/obs-visibility-timer

Where that script disables sources at the end of the timer, this script sets sceneitem visibility to "false", enabling sceneitem hide transitions to run.

Additionally, this version is greatly pared down from the original, allowing only hide timers, not show timers or repeat timers.
